This repository will be used to help me catalog my work and allow others to see what I've been doing. Due to my lacking Github proficiency this page will likely be bare-bones for a while. My work within the Collegeville community largely revolves around writing for the Exascale Computing Project. Currently I'm working on a few Wikipedia articles and doing research to more familiarize myself with this field.
